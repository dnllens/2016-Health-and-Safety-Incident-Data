# 2016 Wind Industry Health and Safety Incident Analysis

## Project Overview
This repository contains data, analysis scripts, and visualizations for health and safety incidents that occurred in the wind industry during 2016. The project's goal is to uncover patterns, understand risk factors, and enhance safety standards within the industry.

## Data Source
The dataset comprises recorded incidents from the wind industry in the year 2016, capturing various aspects such as incident type, severity, and outcomes.

## Methodology
### Data Preprocessing
- **Tool Used**: Python
- **Description**: Raw data was cleaned and preprocessed using Python to ensure consistency and prepare it for analysis. This involved handling missing values, standardizing date formats, and categorizing incidents.

### Data Analysis
- **Tool Used**: SQL
- **Description**: Using SQL, the preprocessed data was analyzed to extract insights. The analysis focused on identifying incident trends, common types of incidents, and their potential for causing harm.

### Data Visualization
- **Tool Used**: Power BI
- **Description**: Interactive dashboards and visualizations were created in Power BI, providing an intuitive representation of the analysis results.

## Results and Insights
The analysis revealed that the UK had a higher number of incidents compared to the EU, despite fewer work hours. Approximately 11.8% of the 983 incidents in 2016 had serious consequences, but only 1% required emergency medical evacuation, and there were no fatalities. Notably, 16% of incidents marked with a low potential for harm resulted in serious injuries, suggesting a need for revising risk assessment procedures.
